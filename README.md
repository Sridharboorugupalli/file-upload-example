File Upload Example
===================
Not really an example as much as me testing out different means of uploading files in Spring Boot apps.

TODO:
* UI means of toggling between the different endpoints that parse uploads differently
* Why is commons-fileupload not finding file parts?  Has Spring already parsed the request somehow and we need to stop it?
